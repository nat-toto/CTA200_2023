# CTA200_2023
CTA200 Course
This repository is for the CTA200 computing course which serves as an introductory to coding; the included topics are especially relevant for CITA research.

Motivation:
The purpose for taking this course is to build skills that will allow me to work with my post doc on my summer project.
Furthermore, CTA200 will also serve as a foundation for many more coding/computing classes in the future.

In this repository:
In this Github repo, you will find folders for different assignments, all of which pertain to the topic at hand.
The folders include images, .tex files, and also .ipynb files.

Python is mainly being used here. Some tools I use include numpy, matplotlib, etc.

All that is included in this repo summarizes my learning during the 2 weeks of this course.
